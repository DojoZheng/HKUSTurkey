# Initialization
1. Firstly, use the file `envirnment.yml` to set up a conda environment called `hkust-env`. To be more detail, you can go to the directory and execute the following command in your terminal.
```
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

2. Secondly, after the installation, execute the command line `source activate hkust-env`（Mac/Linux）or `activate hkust-env`（Windows）to activate the environment so that you can run the source code.
